# webpack-starter-kit-pixijs

1. To run the app, clone, fork or download it. 
2. Make sure you have Node and npm installed. 
3. Run ```npm install``` or ```npm i```
4. Then run ```npm run dev```

This will build the app, put ```index.html``` into the ```dist``` folder along with ```index.js```.

The app runs webpack dev server with hot reloading. So, any changes you make to ```index.js``` will rebuild the app.
